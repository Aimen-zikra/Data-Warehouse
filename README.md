# Data-Warehouse-Project

## 🌟 Welcome to My Data Warehouse & Analytics Project!

This project is a data warehousing solution designed to showcase practical, real-world data engineering and analytics skills.
Built entirely with **MySQL**, it simulates a **production-grade data warehouse** that integrates **ERP and CRM sales data** to uncover meaningful, data-driven business insights.

### 💡 What This Project Demonstrates

- **Modern Data Architecture:** A clean, scalable warehouse design following best practices.
- **ETL Pipelines:** Automated and optimized data extraction, transformation, and loading workflows.
- **Data Modeling:** A well-structured schema built for analytics performance and flexibility.
- **SQL Analytics:** Advanced SQL queries and dashboards that deliver actionable insights for decision-making.

Single MySQL schema with **prefix-based layering** (bronze_, silver_, gold_) — no separate databases needed.

| Layer | Purpose | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Bronze** | Raw ingestion | bronze_erp_*, bronze_crm_* tables loaded via LOAD DATA INFILE |
| **Silver** | Cleansed & validated | silver_erp_*, silver_crm_* with deduplication, standardization, joins |
| **Gold** | Analytics-ready | Star schema: gold_fact_sales, gold_dim_customer, gold_dim_product |

> MySQL Workbench used for design, execution, and visualization.

📋 Specifications:
| **Requirement**      | **Implementation**                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Sources**     | Import **CSV files** from two source systems — **ERP** and **CRM** — containing sales, customer, and product data.                                                                                                                              |
| **Data Ingestion**   | Load raw data into **Bronze Layer** tables using:<br>• `LOAD DATA INFILE` commands<br>• or **MySQL Workbench Table Data Import Wizard**                                                                                                         |
| **Data Quality**     | Perform thorough data cleansing to address:<br>• Duplicate records<br>• Inconsistent naming or formatting<br>• Missing values<br>• Data type mismatches                                                                                         |
| **Data Integration** | Combine overlapping entities (e.g., **customers**, **products**) from ERP and CRM into **unified Silver Layer** tables using **common business keys** for consistency.                                                                          |
| **Data Modeling**    | Design a **star schema** in the **Gold Layer**, consisting of:<br>• `gold_fact_sales` – central fact table<br>• `gold_dim_customers`, `gold_dim_products` – supporting dimension tables                                                         |
| **Scope**            | Process only the **latest snapshot** of data; **no historical tracking** (no Slowly Changing Dimensions required).                                                                                                                              |
| **Documentation**    | Provide comprehensive documentation of the data model and pipeline to support both technical and non-technical stakeholders. |
| **Environment**      | Implemented in **MySQL 8.0+**, using a single schema named **`DataWarehouse`**, structured with **layer prefixes**:<br>• `bronze_` (raw)<br>• `silver_` (cleansed/integrated)<br>• `gold_` (analytical)                                         |

## 🌟Data Analytics: Deliver Actionable Insights

**📝Objective**  
Leverage **production-grade SQL** and **Python (Pandas)** to extract deep business intelligence from sales, customer, and product data — delivering **KPIs**, **trend analysis**, and **strategic recommendations** to drive revenue, retention, and operational efficiency.

> **📌Dual-Stack Approach**:  
> - **SQL**: Scalable, production-ready queries on a **gold-layer data warehouse**  
> - **Python (Pandas)**: Rapid validation, transformation, and visualization  
> **Result**: 100% consistency across both tools — enterprise-grade reliability

| **Monthly Revenue & MoM Growth** | [`business_metrics.sql`](./business_metrics.sql) | `df.groupby('month')['sales_amount'].sum()` |
| **Top 10 Products by Revenue** | [`business_metrics.sql`](./business_metrics.sql) | `df.merge(products).groupby('product_name')...` |
| **Customer Lifetime Value** | `JOIN` on `gold_dim_customers` | `df.groupby('customer_key').agg(...)` |
| **Profit Margin per Product** | `SUM(sales - cost)` | `df['profit'] = df['sales'] - df['cost']` |
